# Epicodus Track Suggester Project

#### _A questionnaire that uses JavaScript branching to inform users what programming track is best for them, August 10, 2018._

#### By _**Brendan Shea**_

## Description

_This web application is for users who are interested in programming at Epicodus, but they aren't sure which language is the right fit for them. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide users with the programming track that is best for them after answering 5 questions. Each question is related to one of the 3 tracks, so if the user answers 2 questions for track "a" and 2 questions for track "b," they will be asked to re-take the questionnaire._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Start by creating your directory, making a hidden .git file, and creating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file for all of your code (folders for images and your JS/CSS files are highly recommended for organization)._
* _Create a remote GitHub repository and link that to your directory using this command: `git remote add "remote nickname" (remote url)._
* _Download both jQuery and Bootstrap and link them in the head of your HTML file after the skeleton is built. Also, *make sure* the element containing Bootstrap *above* your CSS element._
* _Start by creating the structure of your HTML file and create questions for the questionnaire. Also, "a" answers should be equal to JavaScript, all "b" answers should be equal to Ruby, and all "c" answers equal to C#._
* _Jump into CSS and create the styling for your page._
* _Finally, use your JavaScript file to create branching logic using the jQuery framework._

_NOTE: make frequent commits using your computer's terminal and push commits to GitHub._
